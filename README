TLib-PHP

This is TLib-PHP, a collection of PHP classes/functions/stuff that I (Ferry
Boender) deem useful. Examples on how to use the various classes and methods
are found at the bottom of tlib.php. Enjoy!

Included are:

    * A string class (not generic string handling, just useful stuff)
    * A variable manipulation class
    * A control structure class features additional control structure thingies.
    * A simple, easy to use, unit tester.
    * And more... see the html/ directory for a full list.

For documentation please refer to the html/index.html file.
